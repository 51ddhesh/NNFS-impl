# Optimizations

[Previous Session](/docs/Sessions/Session_6.md)

Till now, all the weights for the layers have been initialized randomly. The aim in training the neural networks, is to find the optimal values of weights and biases, so that the loss in training is minimum.


## Strategy - 1 - Selecting the Weights and Biases randomly
Here, the techniques and functions from `NumPy` are used to generate random weights and
